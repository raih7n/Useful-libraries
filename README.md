# Useful-libraries
C++ libraries that I find useful and want to keep track of; will add more as I find more
- [wil](https://github.com/microsoft/wil) - Making the windows SDK not a pain to use
- [phnt](https://github.com/processhacker/phnt) - NT internals that aren't exposed 
- [curlpp](https://github.com/JosephP91/curlcpp) - cURL but with a decent C++ API
